# RealSense Visual SLAM GPU Implementation

An implementation of a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm in an Intel 
proprietary GPU programming library based on Intel RealSense Technology.
Applied the implemented algorithm to a Virtual Reality application exploring the potential
applications of Intelâ€™s GPUs in this field.
Researched the possibility of creating user interfaces in a mapped augmented reality
environment under the advisment of Dr. Yuting Yang.
